## Kubernetes Community Day Helsinki 2025

We will have a [KCD event](https://www.cncf.io/kcds/) in Helsinki on May 6, 2025! This community organized event
brings together adopters and technologists from open source and cloud native communities to share experiences and ideas.
This event is supported by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io).

KCD Helsinki aims to provide an opportunity for Kubernetes enthusiasts to meet and share knowledge among likeminded
individuals. Experience level does not matter, beginners, experts and everyone in between will find interesting
