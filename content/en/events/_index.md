We organized a [KCD event](https://www.cncf.io/kcds/) in Helsinki on May 6, 2025. This community organized event
brings together adopters and technologists from open source and cloud native communities to share experiences and ideas.
This event is supported by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io).

KCD Helsinki had internationally recognised keynote speakers and a wide range of local speakers from the whole
nordic region.
